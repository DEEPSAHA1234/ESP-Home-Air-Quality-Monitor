ESPHome Air Quality Monitor
Continuous integration License
This ESPHome configuration builds firmware for a DIY indoor air quality monitor. It monitors:

COâ‚‚ concentration
PM2.5 and PM10 concentration
temperature, humidity and pressure
It optionally shows feedback for the current air quality with an RGB LED: green if the air quality is good, yellow if it's acceptable, and red if it's bad. An alternative is showing the sensor measurements on a display.

You can build an example implementation on a perfboard in a project box like this:# ESP-Home-Air-Quality-Monitor
